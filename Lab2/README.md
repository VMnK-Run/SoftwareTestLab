### Tasks
1. Write a java program for the given problem:
   Given a positive integer N, split it into the sum of at least two
   positive integers, and maximize the product of these integers. Returns the largest product value M. Input:
   
    N a positive integer
   
    Output:
   
    M the largest product value
   
    Sample Input:

    10
   
    Sample Output
   
    36 (10 = 3 + 4 + 4ï¼Œ 3 *3*4 = 36)
2. Test the program with Advanced Junit Usage. 

    a) Add `@Before`, `@BeforeClass`, `@After`, `@AfterClass` to
   different functions, and write logs in each function, observe the
   execution order. 

    b) Given the input list `testinput.txt`, each line with a test input and
   expected output, separated by comma, eg. `10,36` means `10 = 3 + 3 + 4` and the result should be `3 * 3 * 4 = 36`. Each line only
  contains one test case. Use `@RunWith(Parameterized.class)` to
  load the test file, and test all test cases. 
3. Use Cobertura to produce coverage.
