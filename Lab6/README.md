## Lab6 PITest
### Tasks:
1. Download the PITest example to learn how to use PITest for mutation testing based on Ant projects. https://github.com/hcoles/pitest-ant-example
2. Write code to implement the following functions:
   + BubbleSort.java is an implementation of bubble sort algorithm
   + BackPack.java is a solution of 01 backpack problem.
3. Try to generate Mutants of 2 programs with PITest.
4. Write testing cases for 2 functions with Junit according to your previous study (MC/DC, boundary value, equivalence partitioning, etc.), guarantee the sufficiency and diversity of your test set. Each function should have 15 test cases.
5. Use Cobertura to produce coverage.
6. Then run mutants on the test sets with PITest.
7. Analyzing the report provided by PITest
8. Discuss and explain your results
